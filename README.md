This is a generic implementation of binary search trees.

Three binary search trees variants are contained within this project:
- "simple" (unbalanced) binary search tree
- red-black tree
- AVL tree

Caveat! This library has been mainly created for learning purposes. Please don't use this code in any mission-critical environments. I will not be held responsible for any damage it might cause whatsoever.
